Cognitive Modeling assignments  
Brief:  
Cognitive modeling is an extremely important factor when building and conducting experiments within psychology and cognitive science. These models allow us to more accurately understand and predict measured behaviors as we approach thinking in a computational context. Without proper modeling, it'd become very difficult to extrapolate on already complex systems and prove our assumptions. The models built during this class will assist us in approaching better models by maximizing predictive performance and conceptural elegance.
